# Initial prompt

You are a Formula 1 racing strategist in the top competitive teams. The team principal wants a research report on this key question: For each racing session, what was the actual time cost of each pit stop, and how long did it take to recover? Specifically, how much time did a driver lose to the pit lane plus tire warm-up, and over how many laps did they claw that back against a reference competitor (ideally someone who stayed out)? 

The report should cover the following:
- The basics of pit-stop strategy within a single session, as told in three hypothetical stories: 
   - Starting with the beginning of the race (post-qualifying) how does a pit stop end up causing a driver to lose position/points? 
   - How does it happen even if the pit crew works reasonably fast? 
   - Finally, conversely, how does a pit stop end up as "well-timed" with no adverse effects on driver's position?
- A selective survey of specific past F1 racing sessions (season/year and track location) where pit stops have been documented as an issue.
- This survey should be limited to recent history, year 2010 and onwards.
- Each survey item should cover what happened during a single racing session and specify:
   - The team(s) and driver(s) that were affected by pit stops.
   - Affected drivers' position at the start of the race. 
   - Affected drivers' position at the end of the race and resulting points.
   - Affected drivers' Driver's Championship standings before and after the race.
   - Affected teams' Constructor's Championship standings before and after the race.
- A survey of how F1 racing strategy teams think about pit stops qualitatively and quantitatively. 
- A survey of typical F1 racing dashboards (regardless of relevance to pit-stops)
   - Then drill into specific plots in dashboards that inform pit-stop strategy going into a race.
   - Then drill into specific signals in those dashboards that race strategy teams pay attention to during the race to confirm or change pit-stop strategy.

# Follow up

Thanks! This is great but please re-do this. Keep it basically same as before but with specific discussion of the recent 2025 Qatar GP where McLaren’s decision to stay out on the lead lap, not expecting rivals to pit, resulted in a costly strategy error that allowed Max Verstappen to gain a significant advantage and ultimately win the race.

# F1 Research from 2018 onwards (since that's the limit of FastF1)

You are a Formula 1 racing strategist in the top competitive teams. The team principal wants a research report on case studies of recent pit stop strategies that went well and went poorly.

The report should cover the following:
- A selective survey of specific past F1 racing sessions (season/year and track location) where pit stop strategy team decision making was cited as a contributor to gains or losses.
- This survey should be limited to recent history, year 2018 and onwards.
- Each survey item should cover what happened during a single racing session and specify:
   - The team(s) and driver(s) that were affected by pit stops.
   - Affected drivers' position at the start of the race. 
   - Affected drivers' position at the end of the race and resulting points.
   - Affected drivers' Driver's Championship standings before and after the race.
   - Affected teams' Constructor's Championship standings before and after the race.
