## Specific Data Visualizations

The dashboard is configured to compare gaps between and lap times of two drivers, analysis driver and reference driver.

- **Analysis Driver-to-Reference Gap Evolution**: Plot shows gap between drivers at the end of each lap. Negative gap means analysis driver is ahead of reference driver.
- **Analysis vs Reference Driver Lap Times**: Plot shows lap times for each driver.
- **Tire Compound**: Supplemental chart showing tire compound used by each driver during every lap.
